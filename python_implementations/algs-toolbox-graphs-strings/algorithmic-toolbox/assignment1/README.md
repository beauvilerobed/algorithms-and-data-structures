# Maximum Pairwise Product

Given a list $A$ of non-negative integers, find
the maximum product of two distinct elements (that is,
the maximum value of $A[i] \cdot A[j]$ where $i \neq j$;
note that it may be the case that $A[i]=A[j]$).
The length of $A$ is at least 2 and at most $2 \cdot 10^5$,
all elements are non-negative and do not exceed
$2\cdot 10^5$
