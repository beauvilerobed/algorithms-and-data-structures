# Maximum Pairwise Product

Given a list A of non-negative integers, find the maximum product of two distinct elements (that is, the maximum value of A[i] * A[j] where i &ne; j; note that it may be the case that A[i] = A[j]. The length of A is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10<sup>5</sup> , all elements are non-negative and do not exceed 2 * 10<sup>5
