# Maximum Value of an Arithmetic Expression

Parenthesize an arithmetic expression to maxi- mize its value.

**Input.** A string s = s<sub>0</sub>s<sub>1</sub> &ctdot; s<sub>2n</sub> of length at most 29. 
Each symbol at an even position of s is a digit 
(that is, an integer from 0 to 9) 
while each symbol at an odd position 
is one of three operations from {+,-,&times;}.

**Output.** The maximum value of the given 
arithmetic expression among all possible 
orders of applying arithmetic operations.
