# Maximum Salary

This is probably the most important problem 
in this course! 
As the last question of an interview, 
your future boss gives you a few pieces of 
paper with a single number written on 
each of them and asks you to compose 
a largest number from these numbers. 
The resulting number is going to be 
your salary, so you are very motivated to 
solve this problem!

**Input**: Integers 
1 &le; a<sub>1</sub>, a_2, ..., a<sub>n</sub> &le; 10<sup>3</sup>, where 1 &le; n &le; 100<sub>.

**Output**: The largest number that 
can be composed out of a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>.
