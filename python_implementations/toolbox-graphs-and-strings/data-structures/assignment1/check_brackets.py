# Check brackets in the code

# Task. Your friend is making a text editor for programmers. He is 
# currently working on a feature that will find errors in the usage 
# of different types of brackets. Code can contain any brackets 
# from the set []{}(), where the opening brackets are [,{, and ( and 
# the closing brackets corresponding to them are ],}, and ).

# For convenience, the text editor should not only inform the user that 
# there is an error in the usage of brackets, but also point to the 
# exact place in the code with the problematic bracket. First priority 
# is to find the first unmatched closing bracket which either doesnâ€™t 
# have an opening bracket before it, like ] in ](), or closes the wrong 
# opening bracket, like } in ()[}. If there are no such mistakes, then 
# it should find the first unmatched opening bracket without the 
# corresponding closing bracket after it, like ( in {}([]. If there are 
# no mistakes, text editor should inform the user that the usage of 
# brackets is correct.

# Apart from the brackets, code can contain big and small latin letters, 
# digits and punctuation marks.

# More formally, all brackets in the code should be divided into pairs of 
# matching brackets, such that in each pair the opening bracket goes before 
# the closing bracket, and for any two pairs of brackets either one of them 
# is nested inside another one as in (foo[bar]) or they are separate as in 
# f(a,b)-g[c]. The bracket [ corresponds to the bracket ], { corresponds to }, 
# and ( corresponds to ).
