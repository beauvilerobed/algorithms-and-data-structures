Each assignment contains an `assignment_name.py` and a `tests.py` that runs algorithms against the examples test cases. 

`cd some_topic/assignment_number` then run `python3 tests.py`.
For example to get to `assignment 2 - Dijkstra's Shortest Path` 
`cd graph-search-shortest-paths/assignment2` then run `python3 tests.py`.
