# Programming Assignment #2

In this assignment you will implement one or more algorithms for the traveling salesman problem, such as the dynamic programming algorithm covered in the video lectures.

The first line indicates the number of cities. Each city is a point in the plane, and each subsequent line indicates the x- and y-coordinates of a single city.

The distance between two cities is defined as the Euclidean distance --- that is, two cities at locations (x,y) and (z,w) have distance sqrt((x−z)2+(y−w)2) between them.

Submit the minimum cost of a traveling salesman tour for this instance, rounded down to the nearest integer.
