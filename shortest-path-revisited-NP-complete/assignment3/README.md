# Programming Assignment #3

This folder contains a program that finds the minimum cost tour (approx.) for a travelling salesman i.e. given n vertices, it finds a minimum cost tour (a cyclic path) that visits all vertices by using the Nearest Neighbor heuristic. Since a heuristic is used, the answer is not the absolute optimal but in close range to it. Also, the running time of this heuristic is O(n^2) instead of the O(n^2 * 2^n) achieved by the proper soltuion.
