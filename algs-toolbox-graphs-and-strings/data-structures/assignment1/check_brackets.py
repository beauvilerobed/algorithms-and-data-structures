# Check brackets in the code

# Task. Your friend is making a text editor for programmers. He is
# currently working on a feature that will find errors in the usage
# of different types of brackets. Code can contain any brackets
# from the set []{}(), where the opening brackets are [,{, and ( and
# the closing brackets corresponding to them are ],}, and ).

# For convenience, the text editor should not only inform the user that
# there is an error in the usage of brackets, but also point to the
# exact place in the code with the problematic bracket. First priority
# is to find the first unmatched closing bracket which either doesnâ€™t
# have an opening bracket before it, like ] in ](), or closes the wrong
# opening bracket, like } in ()[}. If there are no such mistakes, then
# it should find the first unmatched opening bracket without the
# corresponding closing bracket after it, like ( in {}([]. If there are
# no mistakes, text editor should inform the user that the usage of
# brackets is correct.

# Apart from the brackets, code can contain big and small latin letters,
# digits and punctuation marks.

# More formally, all brackets in the code should be divided into pairs of
# matching brackets, such that in each pair the opening bracket goes before
# the closing bracket, and for any two pairs of brackets either one of them
# is nested inside another one as in (foo[bar]) or they are separate as in
# f(a,b)-g[c]. The bracket [ corresponds to the bracket ], { corresponds to },
# and ( corresponds to ).
