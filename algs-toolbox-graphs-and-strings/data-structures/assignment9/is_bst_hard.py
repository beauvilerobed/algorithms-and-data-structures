# Is it a binary search tree? Hard version.


# Task. You are given a binary tree with integers as its keys. 
# You need to test whether it is a correct binary search tree. 
# Note that there can be duplicate integers in the tree, and this 
# is allowed. The definition of the binary search tree in such 
# case is the following: for any node of the tree, if its key 
# is 𝑥, then for any node in its left subtree its key must be 
# strictly less than 𝑥, and for any node in its right subtree
# its key must be greater than or equal to 𝑥. In other words, 
# smaller elements are to the left, bigger elements are to the right, 
# and duplicates are always to the right. You need to check whether 
# the given binary tree structure satisfies this condition. You are 
# guaranteed that the input contains a valid binary tree. That is, 
# it is a tree, and each node has at most two children.
