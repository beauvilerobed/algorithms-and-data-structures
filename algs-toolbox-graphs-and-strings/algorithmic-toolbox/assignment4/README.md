# Greatest Common Divisor

The greatest common divisor 
<b><em>GCD</em></b> of <b><em>a</em></b>  and <b><em>b</em></b> of two positive 
integers a and b is the largest integer d 
that divides both a and b. The solution 
of the Greatest Common Divisor Problem was 
first described (but not discovered!) by 
the Greek mathematician Euclid twenty 
three centuries ago. But the name of 
a mathematician who discovered this algorithm, 
a century before Euclid described it, remains 
unknown. Centuries later, Euclid's algorithm 
was re-discovered by Indian and Chinese astronomers. 
Now, efficient algorithm for computing the greatest 
common divisor is an important ingredient of modern 
cryptographic algorithms. 

# Task

Your goal is to implement Euclid's algorithm for computing <b><em>GCD</em></b> of <b><em>a</em></b>  and <b><em>b</em></b>. 

Implement a function that computes the greatest
common divisor of two integers
1 &le; a, b &le; 2 &times; 10<sup>9</sup>.
